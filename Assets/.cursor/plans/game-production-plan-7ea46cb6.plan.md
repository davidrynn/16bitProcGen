## Technical Considerations

### DOTS Integration

- Continue hybrid DOTS + MonoBehaviour approach where appropriate
- Player systems can be DOTS-based for performance
- UI can remain MonoBehaviour for ease of development
- Maintain existing DOTS patterns (partial classes, one per file, etc.)

### Art Pipeline

- Follow established 16-bit art direction (low-poly, flat shading, small textures)
- Use Blender for modeling, export to FBX
- Create prefabs with Authoring + Baker pattern
- Bake to Entity prefabs in SubScenes

### Performance Budget

- Maintain 60 FPS target on mid-range hardware
- Leverage compute shaders for heavy computation
- Use DOTS Jobs for parallelizable work
- Implement aggressive LOD and culling

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- **Slingshot movement feel**: Requires significant iteration to feel good
- **World persistence**: Complex system with potential for bugs
- **Performance at scale**: Large worlds may strain streaming system

### Medium Risk

- **Crafting balance**: Requires extensive playtesting
- **Biome variety**: Needs strong art direction to feel distinct
- **Progression pacing**: Easy to make too grindy or too fast

### Low Risk

- **Magic hand destruction**: Core tech already exists
- **Resource collection**: Simple extension of existing systems
- **UI implementation**: Well-understood problem space

---

## Success Metrics

### Core Loop

- Player spends 70%+ time in exploration/movement
- Destruction feels satisfying (player feedback)
- Resource collection feels rewarding, not tedious

### Engagement

- Average session length: 30-60 minutes
- Player reaches mid-game progression: 80%+ of players
- Player completes game: 40%+ of players

### Technical

- Maintains 60 FPS: 95%+ of time
- Zero crashes: 99.9%+ uptime
- Save/load success rate: 100%

---

## Next Action

**Recommendation**: Start with Phase 1.1 (Magic Hand System) and 1.2 (Slingshot Movement) in parallel, as these define the core feel of the game. Once movement feels good, the rest of the game can be built around it.
