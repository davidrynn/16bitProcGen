## General Setup Tips

### Prerequisites
- **Always ensure `ComputeShaderManager` and `TerrainEntityManager` are present**
- Most tests will create them if missing
- Check the Unity Console for logs and errors—most tests provide detailed output

### Important: DOTS System Conflicts
**Problem**: You may see duplicate terrain objects (e.g., `TerrainChunk_0_0` AND `DOTS_TerrainMesh_0_0`)

**Cause**: DOTS systems automatically run and process terrain entities created by test scripts, creating their own visual representations.

**Solutions**:
1. **For Test Scripts**: The `HybridTerrainGenerationSystem` is temporarily disabled to prevent conflicts
2. **For DOTS Systems**: Comment out the `return;` statement in `HybridTerrainGenerationSystem.OnUpdate()` and remove test scripts
3. **Separate Scenes**: Use different scenes for testing vs. DOTS system development

**Current Setup**: Test scripts are prioritized - DOTS systems are disabled to prevent conflicts.

### Configuration Management
**TerrainGenerationSettings**: The system now uses a ScriptableObject for configuration instead of hard-coded values.

**To configure settings**:
1. **Create settings asset**: Right-click in Project → Create → DOTS → Terrain → Generation Settings
2. **Place in Resources folder**: Move the asset to `Resources/TerrainGenerationSettings.asset`
3. **Modify in Inspector**: All settings are now configurable without code changes

**Settings include**:
- **Performance**: Max chunks per frame, buffer sizes
- **Noise**: Scale, height multiplier, biome scale, noise offset
- **Visual**: Mesh height scale
- **Debug**: Logging toggles
- **Terrain Types**: Height thresholds for different terrain types

### Configuration Guidelines
- **Use the Inspector to configure test parameters** for different scenarios
- **Start with small test worlds** and scale up for performance testing
- **Use context menu options** (right-click on component header) for manual test control

### Debugging
- **Enable debug logs** for detailed troubleshooting
- **Check system status** using the debug GUIs
- **Monitor performance metrics** for optimization opportunities

### Best Practices
- **Run tests in isolation** to identify specific issues
- **Use consistent test parameters** for reproducible results
- **Document any test failures** with specific error messages and conditions

## Example Test Scenarios

### Small Test World
```csharp
numberOfEntities = 4;    // 2x2 grid
resolution = 32;         // Medium detail
worldScale = 5f;         // 5x5 world units per chunk
// Result: 10x10 world units total
```

### Large Test World
```csharp
numberOfEntities = 16;   // 4x4 grid
resolution = 64;         // High detail
worldScale = 20f;        // 20x20 world units per chunk
// Result: 80x80 world units total
```

### Performance Test
```csharp
numberOfEntities = 25;   // 5x5 grid
resolution = 128;        // Very high detail
worldScale = 50f;        // 50x50 world units per chunk
// Result: 250x250 world units total (stress test)
```

### Quick Validation Test
```csharp
numberOfEntities = 1;    // Single chunk
resolution = 16;         // Low detail
worldScale = 1f;         // 1x1 world units
// Result: Quick validation of core systems
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Test Setup Failures
- **Missing DOTS packages**: Ensure all required DOTS packages are installed
- **Compute shader not found**: Check that compute shaders are in the Resources/Shaders folder
- **World not initialized**: Wait a frame for DOTS to initialize before running tests

### Performance Issues
- **High memory usage**: Reduce resolution or number of entities
- **Slow generation**: Check compute shader performance and GPU utilization
- **Frame rate drops**: Monitor chunk count and detail level

### Visual Issues
- **No terrain visible**: Check camera position and lighting
- **Incorrect heights**: Verify noise parameters and world scale
- **Missing colors**: Ensure height colors are enabled in test settings
- **Duplicate terrain objects**: See "DOTS System Conflicts" section above - this is normal when both systems are active

### Memory Management
- **BlobBuilder memory leaks**: Ensure test entities are properly cleaned up
- **Use "Cleanup Test Entities"**: Right-click on HybridGenerationTest component to manually clean up
- **Monitor memory usage**: Check Profiler for BlobAssetReference leaks
- **Automatic cleanup**: Test entities are automatically cleaned up when test is destroyed
